This project is about the creation of a To-Do List. It's written on JS React and planned to be transferred to Typescript.

I did it under the supervision of my dear friend and colleague - Ilya Grebyonkin.

Main commands:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `prettier write`
npx prettier . --write
